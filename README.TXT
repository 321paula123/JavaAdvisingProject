PROJECT TITLE: Advising Tool for Computational Data Science Undergraduate Students
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Students can list the courses they have taken in a text file, and the program will output the
data science courses they can take next based on the prerequisites they have satisfied.
DATE: 1/1/2018
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Enter course numbers into PastCourses.txt. Each course should be on it's own line. For example:
CDS 130
CDS 151

For a list of possible courses that may be entered, see: https://catalog.gmu.edu/colleges-schools/science/computational-data-sciences/computational-data-sciences-bs/#requirementstext
Save the file, and then run Main.java
